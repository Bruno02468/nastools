# nastools

A library (and some associated tools) to parse the data within Nastran printout
output files, commonly referred to by their extension F06.

The parsed data can then be manipulated with high-level data structures,
converted, etc.

This entire repository is:
  - in the public domain,
  - a work-in-progress, and
  - part of the [MYSTRAN](https://mystran.com) project.

Therefore, expect:
  - no trouble using this however and for whatever you want,
  - bugs/incomplete stuff/really fast changes, and
  - an emphasis on MYSTRAN and Simcenter Nastran support.

However, know that:
  - I'd appreciate if you give me credit,
  - I try to keep code tidy and well-documented, and
  - I made it really easy to add support for different solvers.

I hope you find this useful! =D
